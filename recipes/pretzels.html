<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Pretzels are a popular snack that originated in Europe and have become a beloved treat around the world. They are typically made 
    from a simple mixture of <em>flour, water, salt, and yeast</em>, which is then twisted into a distinctive knot shape before being baked 
    to perfection. The texture of pretzels is crisp on the outside with a soft and chewy interior. They have a slightly salty 
    flavor that is both savory and satisfying. </p>

<p>Pretzels come in a variety of shapes and sizes, including the classic knot shape, sticks, and twists. They can be enjoyed on 
    their own as a snack or paired with dips like mustard or cheese sauce. Pretzels are a perfect snack for any occasion, whether 
    it be a movie night at home or a party with friends.</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 ¼ cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C), or more as needed</li>
    <li>4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
    <li>5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or more as needed</li>
    <li>½ cup baking soda</li>
    <li>4 cups hot water</li>
    <li>¼ cup kosher salt, for topping</li>
</ul>

<h4>Step by Step Making</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Pour 1 1/4 cups warm water into a medium bowl. 
    Dissolve yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar in warm water; let 
    stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. </li>
    <li>Mix flour, 1/2 cup sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. 
    Make a well in the center; add yeast mixture and oil. Mix well and form into a dough. 
    If mixture is dry, add one or two more tablespoons of water. </li>
    <li>Knead dough until smooth, about 7 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl, place dough in the 
    bowl, and turn to coat with oil. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until 
    doubled in size, about 1 hour. </li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets. </li>
    <li>Pour 4 cups hot water into a large bowl. Stir in baking soda until dissolved; set aside.</li>
    <li> Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide into 12 equal pieces. Roll each piece 
    into a rope and twist into a pretzel shape. </li>
    <li> Once all of the dough is shaped, dip each pretzel into the baking soda-hot water solution and 
    place on the prepared baking sheets. Sprinkle with kosher salt.</li>
    <li> Bake in preheated oven until browned, about 8 minutes. </li>
    <li>Enjoy your snack!</li>
</ul>
